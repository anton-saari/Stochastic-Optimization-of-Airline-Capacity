# Stochastic-Optimization-of-Airline-Capacity

This study optimizes the cabin seat configuration for a new aircraft type operated by Suomen Lentolinjat Oy. The objective was to maximize the expected value of ticket revenue under conditions of uncertain demand.

A stochastic optimization model based on three demand scenarios was implemented using the Excel Solver tool to analyze capacity allocation across Economy, Business, and First Class. The optimization was performed using the Evolutionary solver engine.

In the baseline scenario, where surplus seats could not be resold, the optimal solution was heavily weighted towards the Economy class, yielding an expected revenue of 120,654 euros. When the model allowed for dynamic pricing—selling unused Business and First Class seats for 850 euros—the optimal seat distribution shifted towards the premium classes, increasing the expected revenue to 136,510 euros.

The results indicate that dynamic pricing significantly improves the profitability of cabin space utilization, particularly in the higher service classes.
